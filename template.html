        <h2>Freshman from Raleigh, North Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman from Raleigh, North Carolina, studying Information Technology. I also work for the BJ Bruins stats team. </p>
         <p>I formally worked as the assistant in an environmental agency. I was also the President of a youth group about 65 strong. That leadership carried on outside of church was my position as the head of small and advanced choir, as well as student council. </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy most any sport, but if I had to choose a top three it would be Basketball, Volleyball and Ultimate Frisbee. Other pastimes include, hiking and swimming in freshwater bodies, playing Rocket League or simply just chillin with friends.
         </p>
